- `cadence•fun panic(_ message: String): Never`

  Terminates the program unconditionally
  and reports a message which explains why the unrecoverable error occurred.

  ```cadence
  let optionalAccount: AuthAccount? = // ...
  let account = optionalAccount ?? panic("missing account")
  ```

- `cadence•fun assert(_ condition: Bool, message: String)`

  Terminates the program if the given condition is false,
  and reports a message which explains how the condition is false.
  Use this function for internal sanity checks.

  The message argument is optional.

- `cadence•fun unsafeRandom(): UInt64`

  Returns a pseudo-random number.

  NOTE: The use of this function is unsafe if not used correctly.

## rlpDecodeString

`cadence•fun rlpDecodeString(input: [UInt8]): [UInt8]`

  Accepts a RLP encoded byte array (called string in the context of RLP) and decodes it. 
  Input should only contain a single encoded value for an string; if the encoded value type doesn't match or it has trailing unnecessary bytes it would error out. Any error while decoding fails the transaction. 

## rlpDecodeList

`cadence•fun rlpDecodeList(input: [UInt8]): [[UInt8]]`

  Accepts a RLP encoded list and decodes it into a array of encoded items.
  Input should only contain a single encoded value for a list; if the encoded value type doesn't match or it has trailing unnecessary bytes it would error out. Any error while decoding fails the transaction.
